# f1-decisions

A tool to download all F1 decision documents from the F1/FIA's decisioning page.

## Description

Written in Python and harnessing the power of BeautifulSoup, this tool is used to download F1 (ie, all documents including the words 'Grand Prix') decision documents from the FIA's decisioning page.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* `python3`
* `pip3`
* BeautifulSoup
* Loguru
* Requests

### Installing and using

* `pip3 install -r requirements.txt
* `python3 scraper.py`

## Roadmap
At some point in the future, I want this to work with Formula E as well, and F1 feeder series'. FE is a bit more of a challenge, because it's an entirely different site, and F2/F3 aren't easily distinguished on the main FIA documents portal.
